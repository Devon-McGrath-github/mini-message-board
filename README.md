# Express Server Message Board

Another Odin Project to refresh knowledge of Express and test out a templating language

I initially tried PUG, but I found the new syntax to be an unreasonably high learning curve for such a small project. Restarted with EJS instead, that is simpler to pick up and implement quickly.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode with nodemon auto refresh.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run start`

Runs app with default script. [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
